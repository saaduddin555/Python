# PYTHON
* Examples of Python code


friend = 'joe'
enemy = 'saaduddin'
print("he is my friend " + friend , "& He is my enemy " + enemy)

    * output is he is my friend joe & He is my enemy saaduddin            # this output is just for refferal

print (((1+2)*3)/4)

    * output is 2.25                                                      # this output is just for refferal


print (2**25)                                                             #'**' here refers to making 2 to the power of 25

    * output is 33554432                                                  # this output is just for refferal

* Expressions &  Variables

    * There are four data types ,

        * Integer : a number that is not a fraction; a whole number.

        * string : A string is a data type used in programming, that is used to represent text rather than numbers. A string is a sequence of characters and can contain letters, numbers, symbols and even spaces. It must be enclosed in quotation marks for it to be recognized as a string.

        * float : Float is a function or reusable code in the Python programming language that converts values into floating point numbers. Floating point numbers are decimal values or fractional numbers like 133.5, 2897.11, and 3571.213, whereas real numbers like 56, 2, and 33 are called integers.

        * boolean : It's used to represent the truth value of an expression. For example, the expression 1 <= 2 is True , while the expression 0 == 1 is False .


    print( 7 + "8")

    output is TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'


        * we cannot use a integer & a string together like this because adding a integer that is 7 with a string "8" is unsensical. adding 7 with a string "8" has no output so it is throughing an error.


*  variables: the computer stores the given variable as a chuck of data in its memory. this lets computer to access the data to read.

script : 

length = 10                             # Assisgnment
width = 2                               # Assisgnment
area= length * width                    # Expression
print(area)


output is 20                     # this output is just for refferal

* Assisgnment: the process of storing a value inside a variable is called assisgnment

*  Expression: A combinations of nos,sysbols or other variables that produce a result when evaluated is called expression.



# valid & invalid variables: There are some restrictions for using 

i_am_a_variable is valid

i_am_a_variable2 is valid

1_am_a_variable is invalid  # this is invalid bcz a variable should begin with a letter or underscore.

apple_&_oranges is invalid  # this is invalid bcz it is using a special character. python variables are case-sensitive, so capitalization matters.but lowercase,uppercase & allcapsnameis all valid in variables
